I know this is a regular getter and and setter pair, but... In the tests, the set method is always called with true as the parameter, so I suggest to call this method simply allowPipelineCreation() without a parameter, the getter part of the pair in this case can be called as isPipelineCreationAllowed(). This suggestion is simply about expressions from the usage point of view, and I don't have a strong opinion on this, however if we want to keep this name and want to name it as a regular getter setter as it is suggested by the books then we should use isAllowPipelineCreation as the getter name.",a more elegant way to do this would be through a `getEngineContext()` method that reinits lazily,"This configures Jackson to exclude `null`, `Optional.empty()` and empty collections when serializing.",assign the guid to the annotation GUID on deserialize.,"Do either LocalName or NamespaceURI have side-effects, e.g. advancing the reader, throwing exceptions if something couldn't be parsed, etc.?",Did something change with Lucene's support for wildcards?
