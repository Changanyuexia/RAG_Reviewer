In other words, we are performing the check twice. I do not think that having such coding pattern is optimal. Instead, could we require every instance of `http_conn_callbacks_t` to setup all the callback pointers, so that we can call the callback unconditionally? For example, you could define default functions that return NULL (e.g. `h2o_http2_debug_state_t *h2o_conn_default_get_debug_state(h2o_req_t *req, int hpack_enabled) { return NULL; }`) and let the callbacks (that do not require a specialized implementation) use the default.",Changing this to an immediate return breaks the timer at line 3795.
